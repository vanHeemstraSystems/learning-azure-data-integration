# When to use Hot / Warm / Cold data path

|Path|Requirement|
|--|--|
|Hot data path|- When data requirements are known to change frequently.<br/>- When processing or displaying data in real-time.|
|Warm data path|- When you need to store or display a recent subset of data.<br/>- Used for data that is consumed for small analytical and batch processing.|
|Cold data path|- When data is rarely used. The data might be stored for compliance or legal reasons.<br/>- Used for data that is consumed for long term analytics and batch processing.|
